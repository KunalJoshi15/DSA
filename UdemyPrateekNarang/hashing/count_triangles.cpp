The problem statement that we currently have is we need to find te number of triangles such that the base or the perpendicular is parallel to the X or Y axis.
The brute force approach that we can use is cconsidering all the elements that we have therefore the time complexity this particular approach will take will be as follows.
In this particular approach we will be finding the point which will be contributing to the triangle.
