Majority of problems. Doing the questions

int a[100];
int a[100] = {0}; -> Will create an array and initialize the elements of the arrays as 0.
vector is used a lot in programming concepts.

Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
Vectors also has the contiguous memory allocations. O(1).
Vectors can be used to create dynamic 1D & 2D arrays.
We will be using vectors throughout the course in place of regular array.
Arrays are pass by value.
