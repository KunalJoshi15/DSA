Majority of problems. Doing the questions

int a[100];
int a[100] = {0}; -> Will create an array and initialize the elements of the arrays as 0.
vector is used a lot in programming concepts.

Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
Vectors also has the contiguous memory allocations. O(1).
Vectors can be used to create dynamic 1D & 2D arrays.
We will be using vectors throughout the course in place of regular array.
Arrays are pass by value.

Height Balanced tree.
A non empty binary tree is balanced if.
1) Left subtree T is balanced.
2) Right subtree of T is balanced.
3) The difference between heights of the left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1.

Dynamic programming is all about learn from the past. We save the answer that we currently have and then if same answer is required for computation again then we can use our lookup table where the answer is stored.

Dynamic Programming leverages the idea of the recurrence relation with overlapping sub problems.

The concept in which we can combine the smaller sub problems in order to find the solution to the larger sub problem.
We cannot apply dynamic programming to the binary search problem. as the problems in which the current problem is dividing into are not overlapping.
