    Map is basically used to store the key value pair in it.
    map<int,int> k;
    k.insert({1,2}); 
    k[2]=100; 
    Square brackets can also be used to update a particular value.
    map always has the value in the sorted order.
    square bracket basically addes the item to the map if it is not present therefore to avoid this .at function is used.
    counting the numbers greater than a particular number in an array can be acheived using map. It contains the element itself and 
    its frequency. (Iterate through the map from back to front.)
