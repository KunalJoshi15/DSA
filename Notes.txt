THere are few things that need to be considered.
For finding the complexity of a particular algorithm...
There are many factors which are responsible... 
1) The machine in which the program is running.
2) The language that is being used.
There will be a certain input for which the one algorithm works slower.
f(n) is slower
Lt n-> INF f(n)/g(n) = INF
Lt n-> INF g(n)/f(n) = 0
This can be proved by taking two functions with different degree of polynomials.

Friend function and a friend class is used in C++ make the private variables of the class accessible to some other class.
Operator overloading is a very important concept in C++ this is used to overload the preexisting operator to perform some other task.
Not all the operators can be overloaded. The one which cannot be overloaded are as follows.
.,::,? and sizeof
For implementing the concept of the deep copy we need to have our own copy contructor.
Forward list is similar to the singly linked list therefore it uses that particular concept only for the usage.

For the min heap with vectors we can use an elegant approach in which we will be changing the sign of the array elements 
and then we will create the max heap while using it we will multiply the elements by -1

There are three types of iterators which can be used along with to the erase function we can directly pass the value which is to be erased or we can pass the iterators 
to the function. (upperbound will return iterator to the upper value otherwise it will return iterator to the lower key)

Map and Set both use the red black tree as an underlying data structure. Map are pairs and they are order in keys.
