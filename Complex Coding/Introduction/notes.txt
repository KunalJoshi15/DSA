Sometimes there are few extra things that are required by us in order to do competitive programming some 
of the portal asks us to create the input file and an output file for printing the result.

Dynamic 2D array can be created as follows
int **arr = new int*[n]

for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    int arr[i] = new int[n]
}

THis memory needs to be deleted now therefore this particular method needs to be used.
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    delete arr[i];
}

delete[] arr;
Arrays in this particular case are passed as the pointers.

Pointers data type is basically used to specify what kind of data does the pointer points to
Declaration and the initialization of a reference variable needs to be done in a single step otherwise it 
will throw compile time error.

We should never return the reference or the address of a variable that is local to a function as 
it may cause a dangling pointer problem.

If we want to create an array of a variable size then there we need to store that particular array in the heap memory
Stack is static allocation while the one in heap is dynamically allocated memory.
