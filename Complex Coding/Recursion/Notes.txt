Recursion provides us an elegant way of solving the problem it basically works with the concept of mathematical induction
1) Find the base case of the problem.
2) F(k) is true assume this
3) Prove F(k+1) is true;

THere is one extended version of it 
we need to prove f(50) is true we can use 
f(0) f(1)....f(49) for proving it
